## **Database-System-Task: JAVA to MYSQL Integration**

**Overview:**

This repository showcases a project assigned in the "Database Systems" course as part of my Computer Science degree. The primary objective is to delve deep into database interaction, illustrating the use of an external database (specifically MYSQL) from a JAVA application.

---

**Database Used:**

- **Sakila DB:** For those unfamiliar, the Sakila Database is a sample database provided by MySQL. It's a rich dataset often used for practice and educational purposes. If you'd like to explore it, simply search for "Sakila DB" and initiate it in your SQL environment.

---

**Pre-requisites & Set-Up:**

1. **SQL Credentials:** Please be aware that you'll require a username and password for accessing the SQL environment.
   
2. **Connector:** To establish a bridge between SQL and JAVA, a connector is mandatory. This repository already includes the necessary connector, pre-embedded for your convenience. If you're setting this up elsewhere, ensure to download the appropriate connector and place it in the 'lib' folder.

---

**Instructions & Usage:**

1. **Setting up Sakila:** Begin by setting up the Sakila DB in your MySQL environment. If unfamiliar, a simple Google search should provide all the steps you need.

2. **Connector Placement:** If you haven't already, ensure the connector for SQL & JAVA interaction is present in the 'lib' folder. This is crucial for the seamless operation of the project.

3. **Launch & Explore:** With the above steps completed, launch the JAVA application and start interacting with the Sakila database. Experience real-time database operations, queries, and much more.

**Notes:**

- **Note #1:** As emphasized earlier, SQL credentials (username & password) are mandatory.
   
- **Note #2:** While the connector is provided in this repository, if you're ever setting this up on a different project, remember its significance and the placement in the 'lib' folder.
